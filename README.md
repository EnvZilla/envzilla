# EnvZilla: Unleash Monstrously Powerful Preview Environments 👹

**EnvZilla** is an open-source GitOps monster that awakens to create and destroy ephemeral preview environments for your GitHub pull requests. It unleashes an isolated Docker container for every `opened` PR and tears it down when the PR is `closed`, posting real-time battle updates directly to the pull request conversation.

This project is engineered to be a powerful, secure, and scalable beast, using a GitHub App, a Redis-based job queue, and secure token-based operations.

-----

## 🏗️ How The Beast Works

When a pull request is born, EnvZilla awakens!

1.  **Webhook Trigger**: A GitHub webhook event pokes the beast.
2.  **Job Queued**: The API layer validates the event and adds a `create-preview` or `destroy-preview` job to a Redis-powered BullMQ queue.
3.  **Worker Awakens**: A background worker grabs the job. It authenticates as a GitHub App, clones the branch, and forges a Docker container in the fires of your server.
4.  **The Roar**: The worker roars back, posting a comment on the pull request with a link to the live preview.

When the PR is closed, the beast returns to put the environment back to sleep. 😴

## ✨ Key Features

* **GitHub App Authentication**: Secure, modern authentication. No fragile personal access tokens.
* **Asynchronous Job Processing**: A Redis & BullMQ queue makes the API monstrously fast and resilient.
* **Automated Container Lifecycle**: Automatically builds, starts, stops, and destroys Docker containers in sync with PR events.
* **Real-Time PR Comments**: Keeps your team updated by posting status comments directly on pull requests.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The system is split into two primary components for scalability and raw power:

1.  **API Layer (`server.js`)**: A stateless, lightweight Express.js server that only catches, verifies, and queues incoming webhooks.
2.  **Worker Layer (`worker.js`)**: A background beast that consumes jobs and does all the heavy lifting: authenticating, cloning, building, and roaring back to GitHub.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Containerization**: Docker, Dockerode
* **Job Queue**: Redis, BullMQ
* **GitHub Integration**: Octokit, GitHub Apps
* **Deployment**: Docker Compose

## 🚀 Getting Started (The Taming Manual)

1.  **Create a GitHub App**:
    * Give it `Read & Write` on Pull requests and `Read-only` on Contents.
    * Subscribe to the `Pull request` event.
    * Generate a private key and note the App ID and a webhook secret.

2.  **Configure Your Lair**:
    * Clone this repo and create a `.env` file.
    * Add your `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and point `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` to your `.pem` file.

3.  **Unleash the Beast**:
    * Use `ngrok` to expose your local port 3000 and update your GitHub App's webhook URL.
    * Run the entire stack with a single command:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build -d
        ```

## 🕹️ Usage

1.  Go to the repository where you installed the GitHub App.
2.  **Open a new Pull Request.**
3.  EnvZilla will post a comment:
    > ✅ Preview environment unleashed: http://localhost:PORT
4.  **Close the Pull Request.**
5.  The bot will post a final comment:
    > 🗑️ Preview environment has been put to sleep.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting cloudflared (quick tunnels)

If you see logs mentioning QUIC or UDP buffer sizes (for example: "failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size"), cloudflared's default QUIC protocol may be failing to establish on your host. You can resolve this by either increasing your host UDP buffer limits or switching cloudflared to use HTTP/2 instead:

- To temporarily switch protocol, set an environment variable before running EnvZilla:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARED_PROTOCOL=http2
export CLOUDFLARED_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
```

- To increase UDP buffer limits on Linux/WSL2, run as root:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=8388608
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=8388608
sudo sysctl --system
```

Switching to HTTP/2 avoids QUIC/UDP buffer issues and is the default behavior for new EnvZilla runs.
