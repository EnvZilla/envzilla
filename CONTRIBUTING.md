## 🛠️ The Workflow: From Idea to PR

1.  **Find Your Target**: Pick an existing issue or open a new one to discuss your proposed change.
2.  **Create a Branch**: Name your branch descriptively, like `feat/new-roar` or `fix/leaky-cage`.
3.  **Write Your Code**: Make your changes, add tests, and ensure everything works locally.
4.  **Commit Your Work**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
    * `feat: add a new feature`
    * `fix: resolve a bug`
    * `docs: update the documentation`
5.  **Open a Pull Request**: Target the `main` branch. Fill out the PR template explaining what you did and why.
